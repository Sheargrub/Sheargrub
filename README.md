**Hello, thanks for stopping by my profile!** I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Alabama, currently expecting to graduate with both my Master's and Bachelor's in Spring of 2026. I'm passionate about crafting highly extensible systems that expedite development of future features and create avenues for novel end-user experiences.

> Things I've worked on:
- [Original playable content](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sheargrub/myworkshopfiles/) for Rivals of Aether
- A [Rust-based interpreter](https://github.com/Sheargrub/crablox) for the Lox programming language
- [Rivals Constant Flattener](https://github.com/Sheargrub/rivals-constant-flattener), an export utility to streamline Rivals of Aether projects

> What I'm up to now:
- Laying the groundwork for hydrological modeling with CIROH's [DocuHub](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ciroh-ua_website) and [NextGen Datastream](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream) projects
- Collaborating with [Jordan & Skala Engineers](https://www.jordanskala.com/) on a central portal for submitting building inspection forms
- Growing my expertise with web-based development technologies, most notably **React**

> Things I enjoy:
- **Making music!** I currently play the bass for my university's orchestra.
- **Organizing community events!** As a TO, I help to plan and run side brackets at local fighting game tournaments.
- **Bugs!** Also, birds and snakes. Really, I just generally enjoy going out and watching animals.
