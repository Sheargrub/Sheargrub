**Hello, thanks for stopping by my profile!** I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Alabama, currently expecting to graduate with my Master's in Spring of 2026. I'm passionate about creating extensible, reliable systems that expedite development of future features and create avenues for novel end-user experiences.

> Things I've worked on:
- [Original playable content](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sheargrub/myworkshopfiles/) for Rivals of Aether
- A Rust-based interpreter for the Lox programming language (link will be available shortly)

> What I'm up to now:
- Continuing to build my comfort and familiarity with Rust
- Beginning to learn web-based development technologies via NodeJS
- Working on Rivals Constant Flattener, a standalone export utility for Rivals of Aether workshop characters
