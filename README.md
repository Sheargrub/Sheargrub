**Hello, thanks for stopping by my profile!** I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Alabama, currently expecting to graduate with both my Master's and Bachelor's in Spring of 2026. I'm passionate about crafting highly extensible systems that expedite development of future features and create avenues for novel end-user experiences.

> Things I've worked on:
- [Original playable content](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sheargrub/myworkshopfiles/) for Rivals of Aether
- A [Rust-based interpreter](https://github.com/Sheargrub/crablox) for the Lox programming language

> What I'm up to now:
- Continuing to build my comfort and familiarity with **Rust**
- Beginning to learn web-based development technologies via **NodeJS**
- Working on **Rivals Constant Flattener**, a standalone export utility for Rivals of Aether workshop characters

> Things I enjoy:
- **Making music!** I currently play the bass for my university's orchestra.
- **Organizing community events!** As a TO, I help to plan and run side brackets at local fighting game tournaments.
- **Bugs!** Also, birds and snakes. Really, I just generally enjoy going out and watching animals.
